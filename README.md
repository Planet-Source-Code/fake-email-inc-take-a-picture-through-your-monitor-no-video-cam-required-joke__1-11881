### Description

(joke) Absolutley amazing code, Have you ever seen watches that can syncronize with your computer? Well this program uses the same technology, to emit a low light out of the monitor, and scans your face. Develops the picture, then displays it to you! Check it out, run camera.exe before you look at the code :p (PsCode WebMaster's note: This is under the 'jokes/humor' cateogory--please don't download it and then complain if you're not interested in this sort of thing)
